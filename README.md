PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.1 Existing System
The existing medical system app is a digital platform designed to provide users
with general healthcare information, basic symptom checkers, and resources for
managing common health conditions. While it offers a user-friendly interface
where individuals can select from a predefined list of common symptoms to identify
potential health issues and receive general advice, the app may suffer from slow
response times, making the user experience less efficient and potentially frustrating.
Additionally, the app includes features for basic health tracking, allowing users
to monitor metrics such as weight, blood pressure, and medication schedules.
However, these tracking features may be time-consuming to navigate and manage,
requiring users to spend significant time inputting and reviewing their health data.
In addition to the symptom checker and health tracking features, the app incorporates a doctor and hospital locator tool, enabling users to search for nearby healthcare
providers based on location. While this feature provides valuable information about
nearby doctors, clinics, and hospitals, including contact details, specialties, and ratings, it may not always offer comprehensive search results, potentially limiting users’
options. Furthermore, the existing medical system app may involve hidden costs or
require paid subscriptions to access certain features or premium content, which could
deter some users from fully engaging with the platform. Despite serving as a valuable
resource for general healthcare information and basic health tracking, the app’s slow
response time, time-consuming features, potential limitations in search capabilities,
and associated costs may hinder its overall usability and user satisfaction.
3.1.1 Disadvantages of Existing System:
• Slow response time, leading to delays in accessing information.
• Time-consuming features, requiring significant input and review of health data.
