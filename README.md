Project Title: Personalized Medicine Recommendation System
Abstract
The project aims to develop a comprehensive system for personalized medicine recommendation using machine learning models. Leveraging Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, the system offers tailored treatment recommendations based on individual patient attributes, including genetic information, medical history, demographics, and lifestyle factors. The report outlines the systematic workflow involved in the development of the recommendation system, starting from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment. Special attention is given to feature selection, data normalization, and hyperparameter optimization to ensure robust performance and generalizability of the SVM model. The project’s significance lies in its contribution to the advancement of healthcare systems towards a more personalized and data-driven approach. By integrating SVM-based recommendation systems, healthcare providers can optimize treatment decisions, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance population health outcomes.
